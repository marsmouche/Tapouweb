		<div class="content"><div class="captionImage rightlite" style="width: 140px;"><a href="../../../dnd/conditions9f3e.html?l=1"><img class="rightlite" title="Conditions Cards" src="../../../assets/adj/conditionsEN.jpg" alt="Conditions Cards" width="140" height="180"></a>
<p class="caption rightlite">Conditions Cards</p>
</div><p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p><p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.</p><h4>Blinded</h4><ul><li>A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
</ul><h4>Charmed</h4><p class="encadre"><strong>EXHAUSTION</strong><br><br>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.<br><br><strong>Level - Effect</strong><br>1 - Disadvantage on ability checks<br>2 - Speed halved<br>3 - Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws<br>4 - Hit point maximum halved<br>5 - Speed reduced to 0<br>6 - Death<br><br>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.<br><br>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.<br><br>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.<br><br>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1.</p><ul><li>A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li>
<li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</li>
</ul><h4>Deafened</h4><ul><li>A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.</li>
</ul><h4>Frightened</h4><ul><li>A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</li>
<li>The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</li>
</ul><h4>Grappled</h4><ul><li>A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</li>
<li>The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).</li>
<li>The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the <em>thunderwave</em> spell.</li>
</ul><h4>Incapacitated</h4><ul><li>An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.</li>
</ul><h4>Invisible</h4><ul><li>An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</li>
</ul><h4>Paralyzed</h4><ul><li>A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can't move or speak.</li>
<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
<li>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</li>
</ul><h4>Petrified</h4><ul><li>A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.</li>
<li>The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
<li>The creature has resistance to all damage.</li>
<li>The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.</li>
</ul><h4><img class="rightlite" title="" src="../../../assets/regles/conditions.jpg" alt="conditions" width="317" height="600">Poisoned</h4><ul><li>A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</li>
</ul><h4>Prone</h4><ul><li>A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.</li>
<li>The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.</li>
<li>An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</li>
</ul><h4>Restrained</h4><ul><li>A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
<li>The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</li>
</ul><h4>Stunned</h4><ul><li>A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move, and can speak only falteringly.</li>
<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
</ul><h4>Unconscious</h4><ul><li>An unconscious creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</li>
<li>The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.</li>
<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
<li>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</li>
