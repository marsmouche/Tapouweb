		<h1>Dragonmarks</h1>
		<div class="content"><p>A dragonmark is a mystic sigil that appears on the skin. The mark is a source of mystical power and enhances the bearer’s ability to perform certain tasks. In Eberron, each mark is tied to specific bloodlines. The families that carry these marks joined together to form the Dragonmarked Houses, powerful forces that dominate different industries. Not every member of a given family possesses a dragonmark; conversely, merely possessing a dragonmark does not grant special status within the house. In creating a dragonmarked character, your background can help to establish your relationship to the house. A dragonmarked noble may be part of the ruling family. A guild artisan or entertainer can work in one of the house guilds. A criminal may have been exiled from their house, while an urchin could be an orphan who never knew they had a tie to one of the dragonmarked families.</p><h2>Creating a Dragonmarked Character</h2><p>Dragonmarks are associated with race and are represented by a combination of variant races and subraces.</p><ul><li>For humans, a dragonmark is a variant race that replaces the normal traits associated with those races.</li>
<li>For half-elves and half-orcs, a dragonmark is a variant race. You keep some of the standard half-elf traits and replace others with the traits associated with your mark.</li>
<li>For dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings, the dragonmark replaces your subrace. So, if you’re making an elf character, you can choose to take the Mark of Shadow instead of being a wood elf or high elf.</li>
</ul><p>There are two additional options related to dragonmarks. As your dragonmarked character grows in level, you can take the Greater Dragonmark feat to reflect the growing power of your dragonmark. Alternatively, the Aberrant Dragonmark feat grants limited but dangerous magical abilities. Aberrant dragonmarks aren’t tied to the dragonmark houses and can be taken by any character.</p><h3>Intuition Dice</h3><p>A dragonmark improves your ability to perform a specific type of task. The Mark of Finding sharpens your senses and improves your perception, while the Mark of Making guides your hands when you work with artisan’s tools. Each dragonmark has a trait that allows you to roll an Intuition die, a d4, when you perform an ability check with a particular skill or tool. You add the number rolled to the ability check. You don’t have to be proficient with the skill or tool to gain this benefit.</p><p>Feats, magic items, and other features may improve your Intuition die. This increases the type of die you roll by one size (d6, d8, d10) to a maximum of a d10. You can only roll one Intuition die for a check; if you receive Intuition dice from multiple sources, increase one die by one type and roll that one. For example, if a dragonmarked trait and feat both grant intuition with Dexterity (Stealth) checks, you roll a d6, instead of a d4. Three instances would increase your Intuition Die to a d8, and so on.</p><h2>Dragonmark Appearance</h2><p>A dragonmark is a distinctive symbol that appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the Mark of Detection across an eye, while another has it in the palm of their hand. Dragonmarks are painted in vivid shades of blue and purple and seem to shimmer or even move slightly. When used, they grow warm to the touch and may glow (though this doesn’t produce useful illumination). A dragonmark can’t be removed—even if a limb bearing a dragonmark is cut away, the mark eventually manifests on another part of the bearer’s body. All dragonmarks share the same initial appearance but a dragonmark can grow in size and complexity if a character takes the Greater Dragonmark feat or if the mark is tied to class abilities. While dragonmarks share the same general appearance, your dragonmark could have a unique quality. If you’d like to explore this, roll on the Dragonmark Quirks table.</p><table><caption>Dragonmark Quirks</caption>

</tr></tbody></table><h2>The Mark of Detection</h2><p>The Mark of Detection is an inquisitive’s dream. It sharpens powers of observation and intuition, allowing the bearer to draw connections and interpret clues others might miss. By actively drawing on its powers, the bearer can detect poisons and study the energies of magic.</p><h4>Mark of Detection Traits</h4><p>The Mark of Detection manifests exclusively on half-elves. If your character has the Mark of Detection, these traits replace the half-elf’s Ability Score Increase, Skill Versatility, and Languages given in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>.</p><p><strong> Ability Score Increase</strong>. Your Intelligence and Charisma scores both increase by 1. In addition, one ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p><p><strong> Deductive Intuition</strong>.

You can cast the detect magic and detect poison and disease spells, but only as rituals. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p><strong> Languages</strong>. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.</p><h2>The Mark of Finding</h2><p>The Mark of Finding sharpens the senses of those who carry it, guiding the hunter to their prey. In Eberron, it first appeared in the Shadow Marches, where clan hunters used it to find their prey. The mark helped unite humans and orcs in the Marches and brought House Tharashk to the Five Nations.</p><h4>Mark of Finding Traits</h4><p>The Mark of Finding only manifests on half-orcs. If your character has the Mark of Finding, these traits replace the Ability Score Increase, Menacing, Relentless Endurance, and Savage Attacks given in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>.

When you create your character, decide if the signs of your orcish ancestry are obvious or subtle.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>. Your Strength and Wisdom scores both increase by 1.

As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is imprinted in your mind until it dies or you use this trait again. Alternatively, you can imprint a creature as your quarry whenever you succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check to track it. When you are tracking your quarry, double the result of your Intuition die. When your quarry is within 60 feet of you, you have a general sense of its location. Your attacks against it ignore half cover. If you can’t see the target when you attack it, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on the attack roll. Likewise, your quarry doesn’t doesn’t gain advantage on attack rolls against you due to being hidden or invisible. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><strong> Nature’s Voice</strong>. When you reach 3rd level you gain the ability to cast locate animals or plants, but only as a ritual.</p><h2>The Mark of Handling</h2><p>The Mark of Handling gives its bearer a primal connection to beasts and the natural world, granting the power to calm and coax.

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p><p><strong>The Bigger They Are</strong>. When you cast a spell that affects only beasts, it also affects monstrosities with an Intelligence score of 3 or lower.</p><h2>The Mark of Healing</h2><p>A halfling with the Mark of Healing can save a life with a touch, restoring vitality and the will to live. When dealing with mundane medicine, the mark helps its bearer sense the nature of maladies and afflictions and find the best solution. When enhanced by dragonshard focus items, the mark can even draw the dead back to life.</p><h4>Mark of Healing Traits</h4><p>The Mark of Healing manifests exclusively on halflings. If your character has the Mark of Healing, this is your halfling subrace.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><strong> Medical Intuition</strong>.

Roll the die, add your Wisdom modifier, and the creature regains a number of hit points equal to the total. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><strong> Jorasco’s Blessing</strong>. You know the cantrip spare the dying.

The bearer of the mark can mend broken things with a touch, and always has a minor magic item they’ve been working on. An artificer or a wizard will get the most out of the mark, but anyone can find a use for an enchanted blade.</p><h4>Mark of Making Traits</h4><p>The Mark of Making only manifests on humans. If your character has the Mark of Making, these traits replace the human’s Ability Score Increase trait given in the<em> Player’s Handbook</em>.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these cantrips.</p><p><strong>Spellsmith</strong>. You can spend one minute to weave a temporary enchantment into a nonmagical suit of armor or weapon. For the next hour the object becomes a magic item, gaining a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a +1 bonus to hit and damage if it’s a weapon.

Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>The Mark of Scribing</h2><p>The Mark of Scribing deals with communication—both the written and spoken word. A gnome who bears the mark can feel words as though they are living creatures, struggling to make their meaning known. The mark provides a range of gifts. It translates languages, but it also allows its bearer to speak to others at a distance and to inscribe their words wherever they wish.</p><h4>Mark of Scribing Traits</h4><p>The Mark of Scribing manifests exclusively on gnomes.

When you do, you become the target of the attack.</p><h2>The Mark of Shadow</h2><p>The Mark of Shadows lets an elf weave illusions from shadows, crafting sounds and images to distract or delight. The mark also allows its bearer to draw on the shadows, making it an easy matter to avoid detection or even disappear while in plain sight. It is a valuable tool for an entertainer, a spy, or an assassin; each elf who bears it will have to decide which path to follow.</p><h4>Mark of Shadow Traits</h4><p>The Mark of Shadow only manifests on elves.

<li>You create a small blast of air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried and that weighs no more than 5 pounds. This object is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. It isn’t pushed with enough force to cause damage.</li>
<li>You create a harmless sensory effect using air, such as causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters closed, or your clothing to ripple in a breeze.</li>
</ul><h2>The Mark of Warding</h2><p>The Mark of Warding helps its bearers protect things of value. Using the mark, a dwarf can weave wards and seal portals with mystic force. It also provides its bearer with an intuitive understanding of locks and mechanisms used to protect and seal. The decision each heir has to make is whether they’ll use this power to keep things safe, or whether they’re more interested in opening locks and taking what’s inside.</p><h4>Mark of Warding Traits</h4><p>The Mark of Warding manifests exclusively on dwarves. If your character has the Mark of Warding, this is your dwarf subrace.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><h2>New Feat: Greater Dragonmarks</h2><p>The Greater Dragonmark feat represents the evolution of a dragonmark—an exponential increase in both the size of the dragonmark and the powers it bestows. Only a fraction of dragonmarked heirs ever develop a Greater Dragonmark. The powers that they possess are more powerful than the wide magic that serves as the foundation of the magical economy. Teleportation, instant communication across vast distances—these services are rare, remarkable, and largely unique to the dragonmarked houses.</p><h4>Greater Dragonmark</h4><p><em>Prerequisite: 8th level, Character must possess a dragonmark</em></p><p>Your dragonmark has grown in size and power. This enhances your existing dragonmark, and the benefits are based on the mark that you already possess. A greater dragonmark provides the following benefits:</p><ul><li>The die type of your dragonmarked Intuition Die increases by one.</li>
<li>Increase one ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20. The abilities available to you are based on your mark, as shown on the Greater Dragonmark Benefits table.</li>
<li>You learn a set of spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot or using a material component.

</tr></tbody></table><p class="notes">* To cast Leomund's secret chest using this feat and the Mark of Warding, you must have a Siberys dragonshard with a value of at least 100 gp. While you have this dragonshard in hand, it serves as the spell's focus, and you can use it to summon and dismiss the chest.</p><h4>Control Winds</h4><p><em>5th-level transmutation</em><br><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action<br><strong>Range</strong>: 300 feet<br><strong>Components</strong>: V, S <br><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell’s duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you’ve halted.</p><p><strong>Gusts</strong>. A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that enter or leave the cube or pass through it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.</p><p><strong>Downdraft</strong>. You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p><p><strong>Updraft</strong>. You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube’s bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.</p><h2>Aberrant Dragonmarks</h2><p>The twelve dragonmarks are tied to specific bloodlines and passed down through families. They are reliable and predictable, and their powers are constructive. They create; they heal; they protect. But there is another kind of dragonmark: marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks often appear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are absolutely forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike; even if they grant the same power, they may appear and manifest in different ways. If two aberrant marks might grant fire bolt, one mark may be formed from scar tissue while another is traced on the skin in lines of cold fire. While aberrant dragonmarks can be disturbing, on the surface an aberrant mark seems no more dangerous or threatening than the powers of a sorcerer. So, what makes them significant? Aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way—a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness. If you develop an aberrant mark, you can choose a flaw from this list, or you and the DM can develop a unique flaw of your own.</p><table><caption>Aberrant Mark Flaw</caption>
<tbody><tr><th>1d8</th><th>Aberrant Mark Flaw</th></tr><tr><td>1</td>
<td>Your mark is a source of constant pain.</td>
</tr><tr><td>2</td>
<td>Your mark whispers to you, though you may not understand what it says.</td>
</tr><tr><td>3</td>
<td>In times of stress, your mark may trigger a cantrip effect involuntarily.</td>
</tr><tr><td>4</td>
<td>The skin around your mark has an unusual appearance: burned, scaly, withered, etc.</td>
</tr><tr><td>5</td>
<td>Mundane animals become uneasy around you.</td>
</tr><tr><td>6</td>
<td>You have dramatic mood swings any time you use your mark.</td>
</tr><tr><td>7</td>
<td>Your appearance changes in some minor way every time you use your mark.</td>
</tr><tr><td>8</td>
<td>You have horrific nightmares after you use your mark.</td>
</tr></tbody></table><h4>Aberrant Dragonmark</h4><p><em>Prerequisite: No existing dragonmark.</em></p><p>You have manifested an aberrant dragonmark. Determine its appearance and the flaw associated with it. You gain the following benefits.</p><ul><li>Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>You learn a cantrip from the sorcerer spell list. In addition, choose a 1st-level spell from the sorcerer spell list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</li>
<li>You can increase the power of your aberrant spells at the risk of your own vitality. When you cast a spell with your aberrant mark, you can use one of your Hit Die to increase the spell’s level by 1. Immediately after you cast the spell, roll the Hit Die. You take damage equal to the number rolled.</li>
